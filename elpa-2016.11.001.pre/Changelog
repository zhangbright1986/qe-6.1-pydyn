Changelog for pre-release ELPA 2016.11.001.pre

This pre-release contains an experimental API which will most likely
change in the next stable release

- also suport of single-precision (real and complex case) eigenvalule problems
- GPU support in ELPA 1stage and 2stage (real and complex case)
- change of API (w.r.t. ELPA 2016.05.004) to support runtime-choice of GPU usage
